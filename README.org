~bug-hunter~ is an Emacs library that finds the source of a bug inside any given ~.el~ file. 

* Usage Examples

1. If your Emacs init file signals an error during startup, but you
   donâ€™t know why, simply issue
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
       M-x bug-hunter-init-file RET RET
   #+END_SRC
   and ~bug-hunter~ will find it for you.

2. If Emacs starts up without errors but something is not working as
   it should, invoke the same command, but give it in an assertion:
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
        M-x bug-hunter-init-file RET (test-the-misbehaving-feature) RET
    #+END_SRC

3. You can also use ~bug-hunter-file~ to hunt in other files, or even
   ~bug-hunter-hunt~ to search in a list of expressions.

* Installation
It is part of Emacs and is available trough [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/bug-hunter.html][GNU Elpa]]. To install, issue 

#+BEGIN_SRC text
M-x package-install RET bug-hunter
#+END_SRC
