#+TITLE: [[file:hunter.png]] The Bug Hunter [[https://travis-ci.org/Bruce-Connor/elisp-bug-hunter?branch%3Dmaster][https://secure.travis-ci.org/Bruce-Connor/elisp-bug-hunter.png?branch=master]]

The Bug Hunter is an Emacs library that finds the source of an error
or unexpected behavior inside an elisp configuration file (tipically
~init.el~ or ~.emacs~).

* Usage Examples

If your Emacs init file signals an error during startup, but you don’t
know why, simply issue
#+BEGIN_SRC text
M-x bug-hunter-init-file RET RET
#+END_SRC
and The Bug Hunter will find it for you.

If Emacs starts up without errors but something is not working as it
should, invoke the same command, but give it in an assertion.
Essentially, if you can write a snippet that detects the issue and
returns non-nil, just provide this snippet as the assertion and the
Bug Hunter will do a bisection search for you.

For example, let’s say there’s something in your init file that’s
loading the ~cl~ library, and you don’t want that. You /know/ you’re
not loading it yourself, but how can you figure out which external
package is responsible for this outrage?

#+BEGIN_SRC text
M-x bug-hunter-init-file RET (featurep 'cl) RET
#+END_SRC

*That’s it!* You’ll be given a nice buffer reporting the results:

[[file:cl-example.png]]
- Are you getting obscure errors when trying to open /“.tex”/ files?
  - Don’t despair! Just use ~(find-file "dummy.tex")~ as the assertion.
- Did ~ox-html~ stop working due to some arcane misconfiguration?
  - Just write an assertion that does an export and checks the result.
- Does some random command suddenly bind itself to ~C-j~ and you can’t figure out why?
  - ~(eq (key-binding "\n") 'unwanted-command)~ is the assertion for you!

Finally, you can also use ~bug-hunter-file~ to hunt in other files.

* Installation
The Bug Hunter is available from [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/bug-hunter.html][GNU Elpa]] to all Emacs versions since
~24.1~. To install, just issue

#+BEGIN_SRC text
M-x package-install RET bug-hunter
#+END_SRC
